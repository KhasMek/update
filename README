This will compile and package a CWM flashable zip for several devices.
Made for jt1134's Vanila Gingerbread.

Usage-
./update/doit.sh [DEVICE]

Default available devices are
	fascinatemtd
	showcasemtd
	mesmerizemtd
	vzwtabmtd

If no [DEVICE] is called, it will default to fascinatemtd for jt1134's ease of use.


example:
./update/doit.sh mesmerizemtd
(will build and package a kernel for the mesmerizemtd)

./update/doit.sh
(will build and package a kernel for the fascinatemtd)
